      <description>&lt;p&gt;we prefer &amp;rsquo;they/them&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we prefer the third person plural as we believe that we are more than one person&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we are typing these letters into a computer keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and we are reading these words on our website&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the plurality of our singularity&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this piece originated from a prompt: a birthday letter from us at 32 to our future present self - and yet, we found an obstruction, a blockage, as traditionally (previously) the birthday letter would be exchanged with one from MADDY, whom we have sadly not encountered for a hot minute. sunshine and turtles going out to you, homeslice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and so, what follows is a treatise on &lt;strong&gt;THE HAIR CRISIS&lt;/strong&gt;, and how it came to be &lt;strong&gt;THE HERE CRISES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People have asked me where I&amp;rsquo;ve been. They&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I&amp;rsquo;m not in any of the photos of Bench in Hawaii, and that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at Eastern Regionals two weekends ago. I&amp;rsquo;m okay, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t feel up to flying to Kaimana or driving to Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;February was a month for me, and really it was a month after a couple of other months. I&amp;rsquo;m a big disc nerd; I love friz. The high of friends + running has always been a solid foundation when other things haven&amp;rsquo;t been going so well. I missed a couple of Brunches with the boys, which was disappointing, even if I think it was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
