Some number of people have never smoked a cigarette. It&rsquo;s a thing that you only need to try once, but likely should not. They will not die from their last cigarette, and neither will I.
I see time differently to most people. I see time as the here, the now, and nothing beyond tomorrow. Nothing beyond tomorrow, because tomorrow never comes for me. I panic about tomorrow, panic that it will come back. It&rsquo;s already back." />

    <h1>Blowing Smoke</h1>
    
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 !mb-8">May 13, 2017</p>
    

    <p>I enjoy breathing smoke, and feeling where it flows.</p>
<p>Some number of people have never smoked a cigarette. It&rsquo;s a thing that you only need to try once, but likely should not. They will not die from their last cigarette, and neither will I.</p>
<p>I see time differently to most people. I see time as the here, the now, and nothing beyond tomorrow. Nothing beyond tomorrow, because tomorrow never comes for me. I panic about tomorrow, panic that it will come back. It&rsquo;s already back.</p>
<p>My brain is not rational, because rationality is seeing what everyone else sees. I&rsquo;ve seen too many things that I cannot forget, that I would singe away if I could. People sleep to forget, sleep to filter out the things that don&rsquo;t matter. I can&rsquo;t sleep because there is no filter; just the here, and the now, and the fire.</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s fire, there&rsquo;s smoke; and I watch where it goes.</p>
<p>I feel frustrated, because my world is on fire. I move quickly, purposefully, and I am always looking at what&rsquo;s not there. I am distracted, because I see what people have left behind. I stop, quickly, and I don&rsquo;t understand how people have time to leave things behind.</p>
<p>I move to relax, move the junk I find to a different fireplace. If I move something, and there is a tomorrow, maybe someone will find it. I find the things that people left yesterday, and I wonder where they will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>I blow smoke, to see where it is. Smoking is a conversation with myself, with my breath, with the other people on the smoker&rsquo;s cough. There are so many cigarette butts on the streets, and I wonder about the people who didn&rsquo;t have time to find a bin.</p>
<p><em>That yellow stain on the tips, the acknowledgment of fireplace.</em></p>
<p>This is not my land, not my home, not my ground to ignite. I am trying to find a place that doesn&rsquo;t exist - one free of my smoke.</p>
<p>I am the fire, and I burn.</p>
