    <p><em>when you have had to make big, adult life decisions, how have you known if you made the right choice</em></p>
<p>perhaps a better phrasing would have been: <strong>how have you known when you have made a mistake?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>we think, now, that the judgment ex post facto is irrelevant; that what matters is making a choice at all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(you, we, me) made a plan, sketched the outlines, the paths ahead, and at some point - this point, now - you realise that it&rsquo;s the wrong plan for the time. the plan is still solid (we hope); it&rsquo;s true to me, from then; it&rsquo;s true to who i want to be; and it gives back to the communities and networks that have supported me to this point.</p>
<p>i am an intensely private person, i struggle with people when i know them, and fear them when i don&rsquo;t. i trust myself - and i trust myself enough to know that i am unworthy of trust. how could i be? i know enough to know that i know less than a fraction of nothing.</p>
<p>to modernise Socrates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we know that we know nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i know that my perceptions are optimised for survival and convenience, not for truth. and if i don&rsquo;t trust me, how can i trust you to trust me?</p>
<p>the plan we had made was a plan for me. it was where i wanted to be, what i wanted to become, who i wanted to be with; and of late, i don&rsquo;t think any of that really matters.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine (mostly).</p>
<p>i like the idea of god the least. i cannot believe the lie, but i hope it brings you comfort; some small comfort, here.</p>
<p>i believe in the idea of an objective truth. i believe there is a reality common to you and i, though our sense may interact imperfectly with it. nothing that i have learned about human cognitive processing leads me to believe that the world, as it is constructed behind my eyes, is the world as it exists in front of them.</p>
<p>towards that end, or the start of that end, words have meanings: it&rsquo;s what distinguishes words from sounds or music. it is how you can read this, once and if you manage to break out of the linguistic purgatory: the hollow realisation that word is the word for&hellip; a word. if you&rsquo;re stuck, i would advise you not to think too long or much about what a dictionary is.</p>
<p>beyond that, words exist outside of intent. this point is oft spun to fit an argument that words have mo meaning - the &ldquo;but i didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, why are you offended?!&rdquo; reverse apology. this is a particularly specious kind of logic: that because a word has one meaning, it can&rsquo;t then have another (and certainly not more than one at a time). much to the contrary, by using a word you are accessing the collective understanding of it that exists beyond just yourself.</p>
<p>we were here, then, but now? ways away and adrift of where we set out&hellip;</p>
<p>what matters, then?</p>
<p>well; nothing</p>
<p>but because nothing matters, everything continues. the strangest part - to him, from us - was that the world kept going.</p>
<p>my reality, my values, were shattered - yet nothing stopped.</p>
<p>this is not new.</p>
<p>and to be truthful, neither is the revelation.</p>
