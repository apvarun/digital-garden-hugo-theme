<p><em>I am already dead.</em></p>
<p>My life, of late, has been suffocatingly dark.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to work for some months. The Monday, the first day of the last week, I went in. I had a panic attack in the lab, and I left. I went home and tried to breathe. The Tuesday, the second day of the last week, I had a panic attack in the lift, and I left. I went home and tried to breathe. The Wednesday, the third day of the last week, I thought about having a panic attack, and I couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>When have you felt the most afraid?</p>
<p>The rush of adrenaline, jaw wired shut, nostrils flared with each pounding breath, the dull buzz in the crevices of my brain that something, anything - everything - is wrong; so very, <em>very</em>, <strong>very</strong> wrong. It builds to a roar and I can&rsquo;t move, can&rsquo;t feel anything but the panic, the clawing need to get away. Fight or flight; but the fear is so strong, the choice looms so large and I can&rsquo;t move, can&rsquo;t fight myself, can&rsquo;t fly away from myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of the cancer. There is no all clear, no cancer free. There is a constant drone, a hiss, that it&rsquo;s there, that it&rsquo;s back, that the scar will spill open, and I will come gushing out. The war is endless, and I don&rsquo;t choose the battles. I wake in the night, frozen, unconscious. They attack in the kitchen, with my partner, with my best friend, with my brother; and I wonder how it looks to see someone tormented by their own mind, trapped behind eyes crushed closed, watching from outside the room. There&rsquo;s nowhere to run - and I am so very afraid.</p>
<p>I am afraid of being afraid.</p>
<p>Light has faded and the night becomes an eerie shadow scape. I haven&rsquo;t slept since Saturday, and part of me worries that this writing is just a phase, that it&rsquo;s just mania and I&rsquo;m bipolar. I have a Psychology degree, I should know. Psychologist often joke that they are just looking to diagnose their own problems. I like the sound of that world.</p>
<p>I ask why. It comes with the anxiety. If I&rsquo;ve thought of the worst case, I can prepare for the worst case. What could be worse than what lurks in the depths of my mind? It cuts both ways though; what&rsquo;s the best case? What is the best life I can imagine for myself? It involves being alive, at lease. And if I&rsquo;m alive, and I&rsquo;m really living, it involves a different mindset. It means rebuilding the parts of my mind that I dropped while holding it together until the first surgery, the second surgery, the next surgery; the parts of my mind that are still fixed in that doctor&rsquo;s office, trying to understand why she wanted to know if Westmead was a <em>convenient</em> place for chemotherapy. The parts of my mind that still don&rsquo;t believe that it was genuinely a misunderstanding, because those definitely don&rsquo;t happen in the real world, to me, a man with anxieties. I can&rsquo;t see the future for all of the cancer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of dying. We all are, I think. Maybe you can get to death without confronting it, if you approach suddenly, or you&rsquo;re so lost in the moment that you don&rsquo;t realise you&rsquo;ve arrived. I can&rsquo;t. I spent so long trying, rearranging, maintaining, just to hold on. There&rsquo;s nothing firm to hold on to, and I&rsquo;ve lost my footing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go back to the carpet store. That&rsquo;s the only rule.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all dead. MY life is diseased, and it&rsquo;s lethal. I am afraid to die as I have been living.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think life has any inherent value. I don&rsquo;t think my life has any inherent value. I avoid. I avoid the panic, I avoid the sadness that my life might always be filled with panic, the depression, the sadness, the tears. I avoid eating, showering, dressing, moving. This is my life without connection. My most basic connection - to myself - has frayed; it&rsquo;s barely a tatter. The things I want to be able to do - to talk, to learn, to move, to share - depend upon connections; my connections.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about the world I live in, and how to survive in it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about the world I want to live in, and how to create it.
'
I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about what matters to me. The things I want to do, the things I can&rsquo;t do right now, the things that bring me joy and move. Mostly, though, it&rsquo;s the people.</p>
<p>I am not afraid to die. Death would be so easy, the ultimate avoidance. I try to avoid the panic, and I&rsquo;m so far from knowing where I want to be that I&rsquo;ve become apathetic. I am afraid, so terrifyingly afraid, of living a life trapped by the fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already back.</p>
