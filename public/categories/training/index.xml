      <description>&lt;p&gt;the first time we ever benched, we were working nights as a delivery driver.&#xA;we had such soreness in our chest that we needed to adjust to driving underhanded because we were absolutely incapable of lifting our arms to our chest.&#xA;truthfully, at times is was an effort to carry a bag full of food from our car to knock on their front door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we will call our first gym partner Adam.&#xA;Adam was a sprinter, a rugby player, a natural athlete and the school sports captain when were in high school together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
