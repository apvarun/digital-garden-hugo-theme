      <description>&lt;p&gt;People have asked me where I&amp;rsquo;ve been. They&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I&amp;rsquo;m not in any of the photos of Bench in Hawaii, and that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at Eastern Regionals two weekends ago. I&amp;rsquo;m okay, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t feel up to flying to Kaimana or driving to Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;February was a month for me, and really it was a month after a couple of other months. I&amp;rsquo;m a big disc nerd; I love friz. The high of friends + running has always been a solid foundation when other things haven&amp;rsquo;t been going so well. I missed a couple of Brunches with the boys, which was disappointing, even if I think it was the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
