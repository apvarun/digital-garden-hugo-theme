we woke repeatedly throughout the night with coaching thoughts racing:
- what classes are we coaching?
- what are the main movements, cues, pops?
- will anyone come if it's raining again?
- what games could we play to get people laughing and moving?
- how can we develop our skills as a class coach?

definitely a trial run of tip/tag for tomorrow morning, channel the inner child on the playground.
