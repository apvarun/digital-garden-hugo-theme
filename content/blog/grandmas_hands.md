grandma was a physio. she always maintained that a good one would be working towards 'return to play', that is, getting you out of their space and back to doing what you love.

i knew i trusted Dave at the end of our first session. i inquired about when i should book another appointment, and his reply was essentially:

> come back when you've done the rehab.

Dave's friendly, charming, and vastly knowledgable about the human body and how it moves. Plus, there's a gorgeous greyhound (?) named Holly in the office and the music playlist is constant bangers, which is an A+ in my book.

finally, i pay actual money for Dave to push needles into incredibly painful areas, and regularly come back for more.
