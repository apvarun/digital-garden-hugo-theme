we dream of being your partner. *of how to be your partner.* and truthfully we struggle with the imaginative aspect of how you are feeling. in this moment (+2025 | 02,20) you are feeling hurt; you are feeling upset; you are feeling that we have other priorities than you. that we lack consideration for your feelings. 

you sent us a message, in anticipation of us meeting on (+2025 | 02,25 (2)) regarding our relationship and what we each want out of it. you described for us what you want, regarding a supportive partnership, working together on our businesses, growing a family, thriving in our lives beyond just struggling to get by.

we read this message and waited to compose a reply. you then sent a follow up message expressing concern that we had yet to reply. and truthfully, we apologise for responding to that message at all; for not waiting longer and continuing to consider our reply to your first message. that was our mistake, thinking that you wanted acknowledgment when you sent that follow up, rather than that you were nervous about how we might respond (or not).

so what do we want?

we want to grow with you. we are particularly concerned about what it would mean for us to get together currently when our financial situation is undergoing an enormous amount of flux. we have gone from a secure salary roasting on a contract at alchemy; to an insecure wage roasting without a contract at the grounds; to now an unpredictable mix of casual barista work, government subsidies, and a burgeoning coaching business. 

you were so incredibly right about the amount of effort that goes into running a business; there's no way to appreciate it without experiencing it. it's also exhilarating!

you met Adelaide at Rob & Sally's wedding. she is exactly the person that we dream about working with as a coach, who values moving and training for the holistic benefits they provide but has had to stop playing ultimate because of the heartache of her recovery from knee injury. today she agreed to be our patron, to support us financially to help  her achieve her goals. this is actually the most unbelievable day for us, to truly be earning a living as a coach.

we dream of working on our business with you, of working on our businesses together. of generating wealth through meaninful work that enriches the lives of those in our community. we want to share that journey with you as you grow Studio Purple. we worry that you see us as a therapy client, rather than a person who would absolutely love to work in an all lilac collaborative space with other people who resonate with us.

we worry if we were together in a relationship about handling the workload, of how we have tried to communicate our boundaries regarding messaging via text and late at night. neither of these we feel are helpful or productive, for either of us. we worry about our need to work, especially while we are completing the internship at the Jungle Botany. that we still need to make coffee to pay our rent; that we have coaching commitments in the evenings, and on saturdays - and that you might misinterpret that as us not prioritising you, when we feel that we are doing exactly that by working to establish and grow our business.

we dream of being a parent. of being, if not a father, at least a father figure to our children. of overcoming our own limiting beliefs around our capacity to be a parent, of our issues with our relationship with our father. of providing everything that we have grappled with around traditional models of masculinity, as well as the warmth and emotional connection we craved growing up.  

we want to be brave with you, which we largely understand to being scared, but doing it anyway. because we know that you will support us as we support you, to live our dreams together.

there once was a unicorn with a beard,
who went to the barber to be sheared;
to their shock, went astray,
their horn chopped away!
now it's just a horseâ€”oh, how weird!
