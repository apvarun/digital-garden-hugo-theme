we made it.

we had a goal, a dream: to play nationals with bench.

but we are also arrogant; we are vain; we are our own ego, maniac.

we missed brunch, we missed lunch, we missed kaf in the between.

there's a speed, a pace, a height - an energy, with opens, that we've missed.

we had a choice: split or mixed.

and really, we thought it was a meaningless question - just put us on the team! any team! 

(but please!)

we would not admit it, if you had asked then - but we think that is because we were scared.

we had a choice, the same as you.

bad mixed is bad, but good mixed is the best.
