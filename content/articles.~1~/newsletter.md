The theme supports a subscription to multiple newsletter providers.

- **Buttondown**
- **Substack**
- **Revue**

## Buttondown

[Params.newsletter.provider] = "buttondown"

Copy the `action` url from your buttondown admin dashboard and add it to **[Params.newsletter.path]** in config.toml

## Substack

[Params.newsletter.provider] = "substack"

Setting up substack is the easiest. Just add your substack newsletter URL (applicable for custom domains also) to **[Params.newsletter.path]** in config.toml

Note that since substack doesn't have a native API for subscription. The theme uses the api from substackapi.com which is in no way associated to Substack itself.

## Revue

Add your revue `username` URL to `Params.newsletter.path` in your config.toml. Once done, the newsletter widget will start showing up in website's sidebar, allowing your visitors to subscribe to your newsletter.

#### How to find your Revue URL to use

Login to your Revue account and go to to `Account Settings`, then the `Integrations` tab. Scroll to the bottom, and click on `Learn more` in **Signup forms** section.
