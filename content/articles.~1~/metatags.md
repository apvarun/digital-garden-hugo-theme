Metatags are used to provide additional information about the page, usually used by search engines and social media websites / apps. It allows to customize your page's title, description, preview image and more.

### Configure default tags

// config.toml

```toml
title = "Personal Digital Garden"

[Params]
  description = "My Digital Garden on the Internet"
  images = ['/digital-garden-logo.png']
```

Setting the above values will be used as default for all pages unless its overridden in a specific page's markdown.

### Customize specific page's tags

Open the markdown file of the page for which you need to customize the tags and set the following properties

// custom-page.md

```toml
title = 'Custom Page'
description = "My Custom page in the Digital Garden"
images = ['/custom-page.png']
```

These values will be used for open graph tags and twitter cards.
